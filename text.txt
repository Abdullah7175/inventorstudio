i need some changes in this website .
you see there are some portals in this fisrt of all i want you to seperate the portals from website then i want you to remmove google auth for now . we will implement it later pleasse do this and make totaly diff folder for portals . 

i need 3 types of portals with this website 
1 portal is for my team and 1 is for customers and 1 is for my SEO expert who will be incharge of maintaining blogs and SEO content in my website and every thing he will do from front end means the blogs page in my website will be managed by my SEO expert he should have an account which i will make from admin panel and give him access to the blogs page and other content adding pages  
and an admin portal for me 

now other than admin there are 2 main types of users 
1 is my team and in my team there will be roles 
like manager , software developer , mobile app  developer , and more depending on my demands of the client i will hire more roles and add in my team later 
and 2nd is customers type: these users will register there selfs they should have a registeration page then login page then they will login by there id we will add the email confirmation and google auth method in the customer registeration later 

now i want these portals to be diff from each other like the admin panel and my team portal will be in white background and totaly diff from the customer portal .

and the customer portal will be same theme as my webiste is . 

now these customer portal and my admin and my team portals are joined via APIs 
since this website is for projects handling and the cusotmers will come and add there project they want to make like in the fiver or upwork the client add there need that they want to make a project the client add his discriptions and pictures and videos and link what he want to make and then that request will be popupped on admin portal and manager of that categoory then that project will be assigned to the concern team mate like a software project wil be assigned to my software team it can be a single member or i can assign more than  one software developer 
then the software developer see the project in his portal with  the details added by client . now the team will start the project and on first milestone the developer will add the first update on his portal which then will be showed to the client portal directly via APIs customer can see his project status in his portal as a tree like structure that where is his project now every status will be updated to the customers that there project is on what stage 
 
i also wants a chat bot in my project i will use free bot for now by google gemni this bot helps the customer to get there answeres and this bot should know all about the projects that are in progress so that he can help the customers in there answers related to there project and if a new customer comes he should know about our services and can enetertain the customers in there queries and if the customer wants to talk directly to our team this bot will help to join there communication like if the developer is already assigned to a customers project then the bot will join the customer and team mate or if the team mate is not availabel then the bot send the customer msage to the team mate email id as notification also the bot will send the notification to the team mate portal as system notification 
so this is i want 

and please donot change any thing in my website it is proper and working i need changes in things i asked only please start
