## 📌 RECOMMENDATIONS

* Use **Replit Secrets** to store Firebase or Google API keys.
* Hide `/admin-portal` behind a secure login or password.
* Use **modular routing** in Express or Flask for clean code.
* Structure `client-portal` with dynamic content per user ID.
* Set up **Replit uptime monitor** if you're using the free tier.
* Consider adding **offline backups** (Google Drive sync weekly).
